		<h1>Tilt Assembly: Building polyominoes</h1>
		<p>
		In this problem you have given a polyomino and you have to build it by only inserting tiles from north, south, east, or west.
		The first tile you can place anywhere but all other placement are not allowed to touch any other tile while being inserted.
		The general idea is that the tiles stick to each other as soon as they touch.
		They get inserted by being shot from outside via magnetic fields.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can play around with the example below:
		</p>
		<div id="sketch-holder-tilt-asm">
			<!-- Our sketch will go here! -->
		</div>
		<p>
		<button onclick="tiltAssemblySketch.resetPolyomino(tiltAssemblySketchP5)">Reset</button> 
		<button onclick="tiltAssemblySketch.undoTile(tiltAssemblySketchP5)">Undo</button> 
		Click <a href="./sketch-tilt_asm.js">here</a> for the source code.
		</p>
		<p>
		Obviously, not all polyominoes can be built on this way but we can efficiently check for constructability for hole-free polyominoes.
		For polyominoes with holes we are currently not sure about the hardness.
		For 3-dimensional polyominoes we can show NP-hardness.
