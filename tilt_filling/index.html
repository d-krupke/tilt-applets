		<h1>Tilt Fill: Filling polyominoes with as many particles as possible</h1>
		<p>
		In the context of e.g. Tilt Map you might be interested in how to insert as many particles as possible.
		Assume you have an entry point with an arbitrary amount of particles and now want to fill the polyomino as much as possible.
		As an additional complication assume that you do not have a precise force that allows single field movements but only maximal movements, i.e., fields always move into the corresponding direction until they hit an obstacle.
		You can easily find examples that cannot be filled completely but how much can you fill a connected polyomino always at least?
		We assume that this lower bound is 50% but currently we do neither have a proof nor a promising algorithmic strategy except for some special cases.
		</p>

		You can play around with the example below:
		</p>
		<p>
		<div id="sketch-holder-tilt-fill">
		</div>
		<button onclick="tiltFillSketch.reset(tiltFillSketchP5)">Reset</button> Click <a href="./sketch-tilt_fill.js">here</a> for the source code.
