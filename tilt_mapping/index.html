		<h1>Tilt Map: Mapping/Exploring an unknown polyomino</h1>

		<p>		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> sometimes produces images with too low contrast.
		For such cases there are contrast agents but they diffuse quickly and some are even toxic.
		Another approach could be map the tissue using a swarm of particles controlled by a magnetic field.
		These particles have a high contrast and can be used to identify the tissue boundaries.
		A boundary is identified if a particle collides with it and thus stops moving despite the magnetic force.
		</p>
		<p>
		The continues 3-dimensional case is of course extremely complicated so let us stick with a simplified 2-dimensional variant where particles move in a grid.
		In this problem you are given an initially unknown polyomino and a set of particles within it.
		You have to explore/map the whole polyomino with as few moves as possible.
		A move shifts all particles one field into the same direction (if a particle is blocked, it does not move).
		</p>

		<p>
		Use the following interactive visualization to get an intuition of the problem.
		Click with the mouse in the direction you want to shift the particles (red circles).
